# Marketing & SEO Optimization for IreneG Mens Hairstylist

## Project Overview 
We aim to assist Irene G Men's Hairstylists' online presence by creating a new website, upgrading the booking platform, improving targeted marketing campaigns, and posting two products to an Amazon Seller Account.

## Problem Statement 
#### The Challenge:

#### Impact on Customers:
- Loss of potential clients 
- Inefficient booking leads to missed revenue opportunities
- Lack of product availability online discourages repeat customers

## Solution Details (Technical Terms)
#### Google Ad Campaign:
To improve ad performance and lower customer acquisition costs, we designed an automated Google Ads marketing analytics system. We used techniques like geofencing, broad-match keyword targeting, and keyword bidding to create a highly targeted campaign. We conducted A/B testing between manually created campaigns and smart campaigns to evaluate success rates. We continuously tracked ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) across various campaigns for IreneG Men’s Hairstylist. We used SQL to analyze our data and identify areas for growth.

#### Square Booking Site:
We updated the Square Booking Site user interface by reconfiguring the layout through the Square Dashboard. We reorganized service categories for easier navigation, applied brand-aligned colors and typography through Square’s Appearance Editor, and added detailed project descriptions.

#### Amazon:
To meet the stakeholders' need to sell products online, we created an Amazon Seller Central account and listed two products. We gathered the necessary product data—including titles, descriptions, pricing, and images—and uploaded it to the platform. We managed the process through a web browser, sourcing product information directly from the stakeholder. We relied on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure via Seller Central for data storage and hosting.

#### Squarespace:
We redesigned the entire website using Squarespace to make it more user-friendly, professional, and functional. We improved navigation, ensured consistency across mobile and desktop formats, integrated third-party platforms (including the booking platform and Amazon listings), and added customer feedback from Amazon and Google. We clearly defined all services and pricing and created an "About Us" section highlighting the owners—all with the goal of increasing bookings and customer interaction with the business.


#### Methodology: 
Our approach follows a build, measure, and learn method. We build technological tools using square, Squarespace, google analytics, and amazon seller central, Measure using the analytics provided from each platform, and learn by collecting insights from data and going to Irene and Jorge for approval and feedback. This was all maintained using SCRUM through scrum planning, standup, and review. 

#### 3 Step Methodology: 
1. Build 
2. Measure 
3. Learn

   
## Next Steps / Future Improvements

#### Scrapped Ideas
We initially planned to set up advanced ad tracking with Meta (Facebook/Instagram), but were unable to implement it due to technical difficulties.
A full Google Ads strategy, including separate smart and manual campaigns, was planned. However, confusion between the two types of campaigns and budget constraints forced us to simplify our approach.

#### Scalability Opportunities:
The brand can scale by expanding product and service offerings.
With more budget, scaling paid media campaigns (Google, Meta) can reach broader audiences.
Improving website infrastructure on Squarespace can support higher throughput as traffic grows.
Areas for Improvement:
Launching earlier would have given more time to collect marketing data before key sales periods.
Managing verification processes for Amazon and website setup should be planned with extra buffer time.
More careful organization between different types of Google ad campaigns is necessary to prevent confusion.

## Retrospective
#### Challenges Encountered and Solutions:
Verification Delays: Verification codes for Amazon and the domain name delayed the launch; we expedited communication with support teams and prioritized resolving critical blockers.
Amazon Product Listings: Issues with ASINs, missing pictures, pricing, and shipping settings were addressed through troubleshooting guides and multiple support tickets.
Advertising Budget Constraints: We had to delete an active Google ad campaign due to a limited budget, which caused us to refocus on organic growth and optimize ad spending.
Domain Configuration: Setting up the new domain name for the Squarespace site was a technical task that took longer than expected, but we learned to manage it using Squarespace’s DNS resources.


#### New Skills and Insights Gained:
Gained hands-on experience managing website development on Squarespace, including domain linking and content setup.
Learned the importance of clear ad campaign structures (distinguishing smart vs manual campaigns) to maximize results.
Understood the value of project timeline management, especially in tasks dependent on external verifications.
Developed skills in troubleshooting Amazon Seller Central issues and improving listing quality standards.
Strengthened skills in social media content planning to support an e-commerce launch with limited paid advertising.
