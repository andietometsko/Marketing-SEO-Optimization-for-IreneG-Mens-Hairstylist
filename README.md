# Marketing & SEO Optimization for IreneG Mens Hairstylist

### Project Overview 
We aim to assist Irene G Men's Hairstylists' online presence by creating a new website, upgrading the booking platform, improving targeted marketing campaigns, and posting two products to an Amazon Seller Account.

### Problem Statement 
#### The Challenge:
- Poor Website Design: 88% of consumers avoid engaging with ineffectively designed websites
- Limited Online Visibility: Organic search contributes 27% of website traffic, yet IreneG’s lacks SEO optimization
- Unoptimized Booking System: Inefficient booking leads to lost customers
- No E-Commerce Presence: The business lacks a way to sell products online

#### Past Attempts and Competitor Approaches:
- Many businesses invest in paid ads, but without proper SEO, they struggle with long-term organic traffic
- Competitors leverage Amazon Seller Accounts, Google Ads, and social media marketing to expand reach
- Current solutions involve basic web development

#### Impact on Customers:
- Loss of potential clients 
- Inefficient booking leads to missed revenue opportunities
- Lack of product availability online discourages repeat customers

#### Quantifying the Problem:
- Poor website experiences reduce conversions significantly
- Lack of an Amazon presence misses out on a $386 billion e-commerce market
- Without digital marketing, customer acquisition costs are higher

**Technical Stack**
SQL (imported Google Ad Analytics into Dbeaver to analyze campaign performance)
Software/Tools:
Google Analytics (website performance tracking)
Data:
Sources: Google Analytics, Amazon Seller Central, Squarespace, Square
Types: Customer behavior data, SEO metrics, sales performance data, appointment data

### Solution Details (Technical Terms)
Google Ad Campaign: To improve ad performance and lower customer acquisition costs, we designed an automated Google Ads marketing analytics system. We used techniques like geofencing, and broad-match keyword match, and keyword bidding to create a highly targeted campaign. We conducted A/B testing with a manually made campaign and smart campaigns to test success rates. This system continuously tracks ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) across various campaigns for IreneG Men’s Hairstylist. Using SQL we analyzed our data to observe our room for growth.

Square Booking Site: We updated the Square Booking Site user interface by reconfiguring the layout through the Square Dashboard. Key steps included reorganizing service categories for easier navigation, applying brand-aligned colors and typography through Square’s Appearance Editor, and adding project descriptions. 

Amazon: To meet the stakeholders' need to sell products online, I created an Amazon Seller Central account and listed two products. I gathered the necessary product data, including titles, descriptions, pricing, and images, and uploaded it to the platform. The process was managed through a web browser, with product information sourced directly from the stakeholder. Data storage and hosting were handled by Amazon’s cloud infrastructure via Seller Central.

Squarespace: I redesigned the entire website using Squarespace to make it more user-friendly, professional, and functional by improving navigation, ensuring consistency across mobile and desktop formats, integrating third-party sites (booking platform and Amazon listings), adding customer feedback from Amazon and Google, clearly defining all services and pricing, and creating an About Us section highlighting the owners — all aimed at increasing bookings and customer interactions with the business.

5-step method project

Step
Description
1. Define
Identify core goals: Improve ad performance, increase service bookings, and drive online product sales (Amazon and Square Booking Site).
2. Measure
Establish KPIs: Ad impressions, CTR, CPA, ROAS, booking conversion rate, product sales volume, website bounce rate, and site engagement time.
3. Analyze
Use SQL and Google Analytics to assess ad campaign success (A/B testing results, geofencing performance), site usability (Squarespace and Square metrics), and Amazon product performance.
4. Improve
Enhance ad targeting (keywords, geofencing, smart vs manual), update website UX (faster navigation, better mobile formatting), optimize Amazon listings (titles, images), and refine service booking paths.
5. Control
Implement automated data tracking and alerts (Google Ads, Amazon Seller Central, Squarespace Analytics), and conduct regular monthly reviews to adapt strategies based on ongoing performance data.

# Methodology: 
Our approach follows the SDLC phases, providing a structured process for planning, developing, testing, and deploying solutions, which fits our project’s needs by ensuring smooth integration of technical systems like Amazon Seller Account, Google Ads, Square, and Squarespace through clearly defined development stages.
##### Next Steps / Future Improvements
## Features Planned but Scaled Down or Abandoned:
We initially planned to set up advanced ad tracking with Meta (Facebook/Instagram), but were unable to implement it due to technical difficulties.
A full Google Ads strategy, including separate smart and manual campaigns, was planned. However, confusion between the two types of campaigns and budget constraints forced us to simplify our approach.

### Scalability Opportunities:
The brand can scale by expanding product and service offerings.
With more budget, scaling paid media campaigns (Google, Meta) can reach broader audiences.
Improving website infrastructure on Squarespace can support higher throughput as traffic grows.
Areas for Improvement:
Launching earlier would have given more time to collect marketing data before key sales periods.
Managing verification processes for Amazon and website setup should be planned with extra buffer time.
More careful organization between different types of Google ad campaigns is necessary to prevent confusion.

# Retrospective
### Challenges Encountered and Solutions:
Verification Delays: Verification codes for Amazon and the domain name delayed the launch; we expedited communication with support teams and prioritized resolving critical blockers.
Amazon Product Listings: Issues with ASINs, missing pictures, pricing, and shipping settings were addressed through troubleshooting guides and multiple support tickets.
Advertising Budget Constraints: We had to delete an active Google ad campaign due to a limited budget, which caused us to refocus on organic growth and optimize ad spending.
Domain Configuration: Setting up the new domain name for the Squarespace site was a technical task that took longer than expected, but we learned to manage it using Squarespace’s DNS resources.


### New Skills and Insights Gained:
Gained hands-on experience managing website development on Squarespace, including domain linking and content setup.
Learned the importance of clear ad campaign structures (distinguishing smart vs manual campaigns) to maximize results.
Understood the value of project timeline management, especially in tasks dependent on external verifications.
Developed skills in troubleshooting Amazon Seller Central issues and improving listing quality standards.
Strengthened skills in social media content planning to support an e-commerce launch with limited paid advertising.
